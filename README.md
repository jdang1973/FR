Here is a **best practice Scrum workflow for Quality Engineering (QE)** within a **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) environment**, designed to align with both Agile principles and enterprise-level coordination:

 Best Practice Scrum Workflow for QE in a SAFe Environment

### 1. **PI Planning (Program Increment Planning)**

* Participate in PI Planning to align testing with team and ART objectives.
* Identify test scope, dependencies, and automation strategy.
* Define acceptance criteria and plan test cases for features/user stories.
* Ensure NFRs (e.g., performance, security) are considered.

### 2. **Backlog Refinement**

* Collaborate with Product Owner, Developers, and System Architect.
* Ensure testable acceptance criteria are defined (BDD preferred).
* Estimate QA tasks (manual, automation, environments, data setup).
* Define Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD) with QE tasks included.

### 3. **Sprint Planning**

* Commit to user stories with clear QE scope and test strategy.
* Include functional, integration, automation, and exploratory testing tasks.
* Reserve capacity for test data setup, bug triage, and test maintenance.

### 4. **Sprint Execution**

* Shift testing left: Participate in design, code reviews, and pairing.
* Develop automated tests in parallel with development (Test Pyramid model).
* Continuously validate stories against acceptance criteria.
* Log and triage defects promptly.
* Validate integration with other teams (via system demos or test doubles).

### 5. **Daily Scrum**

* Share QE progress, blockers (environments, flaky tests, defects).
* Align with developers for continuous feedback and early validation.
* Use the Scrum board to visualize testing progress (e.g., “Ready for Test”, “In Test”, “Blocked”).

### 6. **Story Completion**

* Validate full acceptance criteria using BDD/test cases.
* Complete all DoD QE requirements:

  * Passed manual/automated tests
  * Test evidence captured (screenshots, logs)
  * No critical defects open
  * Automation code committed and reviewed

### 7. **Sprint Review**

* Participate in demos with test evidence.
* Highlight test coverage and defect findings.
* Call out risks or untested areas if story wasn’t completed.

### 8. **Sprint Retrospective**

* Identify testing bottlenecks (e.g., late story readiness, unstable environments).
* Improve test strategy or tooling (e.g., increase automation, improve CI/CD pipeline).
* Encourage collective ownership of quality.

### 9. **System Demos & ART Sync**

* Coordinate with other teams to validate end-to-end features.
* Participate in system demos with test results and QE metrics.
* Raise integration defects and readiness risks.
