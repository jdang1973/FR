## ‚úÖ Best Practice Scrum Workflow for Quality Engineering in SAFe

| **Scrum Phase**           | **Quality Engineering Responsibilities**                                                            | **Best Practices**                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backlog Refinement**    | - Review user stories for testability<br>- Define acceptance criteria (BDD)<br>- Estimate QA effort | - Collaborate early with Product Owner and Developers<br>- Use the "3 Amigos" model           |
| **Sprint Planning**       | - Commit to QA tasks<br>- Identify test design, automation, data needs                              | - Include test planning in Definition of Ready (DoR)<br>- Plan automation in-sprint           |
| **Daily Scrum**           | - Raise blockers early<br>- Sync test/dev progress                                                  | - Participate actively, track test progress with same Jira board as Dev                       |
| **Development & Testing** | - Design tests<br>- Execute manual & automated tests<br>- Conduct exploratory testing               | - Shift-left: Pair with Devs, use TDD/BDD<br>- Automate functional and regression tests early |
| **Sprint Review**         | - Demonstrate tested features<br>- Report test coverage & quality metrics                           | - Prepare test evidence for demo<br>- Highlight automation and defect trends                  |
| **Sprint Retrospective**  | - Share QA challenges and improvement ideas                                                         | - Track recurring quality issues<br>- Improve test environments or tooling                    |

| **Activity**                    | **Best Practices**                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition of Done (DoD)**    | - Include code review, unit test coverage, functional and regression test completion         |
| **Automation Integration**      | - Integrate automated tests in CI/CD pipeline<br>- Push results to Xray/Jira/Xray Enterprise |
| **PI Planning (SAFe-specific)** | - Align testing scope with team objectives<br>- Identify cross-team dependencies             |
| **System Demos / ART Sync**     | - Validate integrated system functionality<br>- Provide QE metrics to ART leadership         |
| **Inspect & Adapt (I\&A)**      | - Present quality improvement stories<br>- Participate in problem-solving workshops          |
