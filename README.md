Here’s a list summarizing how testing adapts in a Scrum environment:

- **Shift from phase-based to continuous testing**  
  → Testing happens throughout the sprint, not just at the end.
  → Testing is integrated into each sprint rather than being a final phase.

- **Testers are part of the Scrum team**  
  → Collaborate daily with developers and product owners.
   → QE works collaboratively with developers and product owners throughout the sprint.

- **User stories drive test cases**  
  → Acceptance criteria are defined up front in BDD or Gherkin format.
  → Testing is driven by well-defined acceptance criteria for each user story.

- **Test early, test often (Shift Left)**  
  → Focus on early test planning and early defect detection.

- **Automation is key**  
  → Emphasis on automated unit, integration, and regression tests.
  → Regression and unit tests are often automated to support fast feedback and continuous integration.

- **Exploratory testing complements automation**  
  → Exploratory testing is used for edge cases and usability insights.
   
- **Regression testing is continuous**  
  → Frequent builds and testing help catch issues quickly.

- **Definition of Done includes testing**  
  → Stories are not complete unless they are tested and validated.
  → A story is not “Done” unless it has passed all functional and non-functional tests.

  - ** Daily collaboration enables quick feedback**  
 → Defects can be addressed faster through stand-ups and continuous communication.

- **Retrospectives improve testing processes**  
  → Regular feedback loops refine test strategies.
