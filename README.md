 

Iâ€™d like to request approval for John A. and See Yang to attend the IBM Safer training on 3/17/2025 to gain knowledge of modeling and case management for current and future use.  

I also spoke with Nora, and if only one can attend, I recommend See Yang, who can then train John Adhero.  

Please let me know your thoughts.
