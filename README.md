In a SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) environment, the Definition of Done (DoD) at the User Story level ensures that a story meets the required quality and functionality standards before being considered complete. The DoD typically includes the following criteria:

Definition of Done for a User Story in SAFe:

1, Acceptance Criteria Met – The story fulfills all defined acceptance criteria.

2. Code Developed – The feature or functionality is fully implemented.

3. Code Reviewed – The code has been reviewed and approved through peer or automated reviews.

4. Unit Tests Passed – The new code has sufficient unit test coverage, and all unit tests pass.

5. Functional Tests Completed – The story has been tested against requirements and functions as expected.

6. Automated Tests Created – If applicable, automated regression tests have been written and executed.

7. Integrated into Main Code Branch – The code is merged into the appropriate repository (e.g., main or release branch).

8. No Critical Defects – All major or critical defects identified during testing are resolved.

9. Performance Criteria Met – The functionality meets performance expectations (if applicable).

10. Deployed to a Testing Environment – The story is deployed to an integration or staging environment for further validation.

11. Documentation Updated – Any necessary documentation (e.g., API documentation, user guides) has been updated.

12 Stakeholder Approval – Product Owner or relevant stakeholders have reviewed and accepted the story.
Feature Toggle Implemented (if needed) – If the story introduces a new feature, appropriate toggling mechanisms are in place.
