Ninad Amin (AVP QE for Retail) and I would like to schedule a brief meeting to discuss the official RACI for pen testing that you mentioned in the Support for FPI Pen Test Team channel on Friday, Feb 7. Our goal is to collaborate with the Pen Test team to establish a standard process, roles, and responsibilities applicable across the Retail team.
