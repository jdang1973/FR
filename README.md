Hereâ€™s a brief comparison of Sync vs Migration for moving test management from HP ALM to Xray:

Top 10 Pros and Cons
Criteria	Sync	Migration
1. Effort	Low effort; incremental sync possible.	  High effort; requires one-time execution.
2. Downtime	Minimal; systems stay operational.	    Potential downtime during migration.
3. Data Consistency	May face sync conflicts if changes occur in both systems.	        Full consistency achieved post-migration.
4. Scalability	Suits phased adoption for large teams.	                            Ideal for a complete shift.
5. Complexity	Requires ongoing sync configuration and monitoring.	                    Complex upfront; simpler after migration.
6. Cost	Higher long-term cost due to ongoing sync maintenance.	              One-time cost for migration process.
7. System Dependency	Continues reliance on HP ALM alongside Xray.	                    Eliminates dependency on HP ALM.
8. Performance	Risk of performance degradation with continuous sync.	          Improved performance after complete migration.
9. Test Coverage	Partial test data sync initially.	              Full test coverage transferred.
10. Future Readiness	Limited; dual systems require extra management.	        Fully aligned with modern test management practices.
Summary:
Sync: Best for gradual transitions but requires dual-system management.
Migration: Best for complete adoption with upfront effort but long-term efficiency.
