Software Quality Engineering Expectations in SAFe
1. Built-In Quality

Embed quality at every stage: requirements, development, testing, and deployment.

Apply practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD), Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD).

Ensure "Definition of Done" (DoD) includes unit tests, integration tests, automation, and acceptance validation.

2. Continuous Testing and Automation

Integrate automated tests into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

Perform unit, integration, functional, regression, and performance testing continuously during sprints.

Shift testing left by creating test cases during backlog refinement and planning.

3. Collaboration and Team Alignment

Collaborate with developers, Product Owners, and Business Owners to define clear, testable acceptance criteria.

Participate actively in Scrum events (daily standups, sprint reviews, retrospectives) and SAFe ceremonies (PI Planning, Inspect & Adapt).

4. Quality Transparency

Maintain visibility of testing status, defect trends, coverage, and risks through dashboards and regular reporting.

Raise and communicate quality risks early to ensure quick mitigation.

5. End-to-End Responsibility

Validate system functionality across team boundaries (ART level) through integration and exploratory testing.

Ensure system-level and non-functional requirements (e.g., security, performance, compliance) are tested thoroughly.

6. Continuous Improvement

Identify gaps and propose improvements in retrospectives and Inspect & Adapt workshops.

Stay updated on new tools, frameworks, and SAFe quality practices to optimize testing processes.
