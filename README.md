Here’s a list summarizing how testing adapts in a Scrum environment:

- **Shift from phase-based to continuous testing**  
  → Testing happens throughout the sprint, not just at the end.

- **Testers are part of the Scrum team**  
  → Collaborate daily with developers and product owners.

- **User stories drive test cases**  
  → Acceptance criteria are defined up front in BDD or Gherkin format.

- **Test early, test often (Shift Left)**  
  → Focus on early test planning and early defect detection.

- **Automation is key**  
  → Emphasis on automated unit, integration, and regression tests.

- **Exploratory testing complements automation**  
  → Manual testers explore edge cases and usability issues.

- **Regression testing is continuous**  
  → Frequent builds and testing help catch issues quickly.

- **Definition of Done includes testing**  
  → Stories are not complete unless they are tested and validated.

- **Retrospectives improve testing processes**  
  → Regular feedback loops refine test strategies.

- **Testing supports fast feedback**  
  → Ensures product increments are always potentially shippable.
