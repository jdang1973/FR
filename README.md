Top 10 key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of testing effort


	1. Test Coverage: Percentage of code or functionalities tested.
	
	2. Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) Coverage: Percentage of requirements linked to test cases, ensuring all requirements are tested.
	
	3. Pass/Fail Rate: Percentage of test cases that pass or fail during execution.
	
	4. Open Defect Count: The number of unresolved defects in the current sprint or at any given time.
	
	5. Defect Fix Rate: Percentage of identified defects that have been fixed.
	
	6. Re-opened Defects: The percentage of defects that are reopened after being marked as fixed. A high percentage may indicate issues with the initial fix or testing process.
	
	7. Regression Test Suite Effectiveness: The percentage of regression tests that catch new defects.
	
	8. Test Automation Rate: The percentage of test cases that are automated compared to the total number of test cases. A higher automation rate can lead to more efficient testing.
	
	9. User Acceptance: Percentage of user acceptance testing (UAT) defects compared to total defects.
	
	10. Customer Reported Defects: The number of defects reported by users after the product release. Fewer customer-reported defects indicate better testing and quality assurance.


Regular monitoring these KPIs can help ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of software testing processes  and help identify areas for improvement.
