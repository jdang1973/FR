### Sync vs. Migration: HP ALM to Xray

| **Criteria**              | **Sync**                                                 | **Migration**                                             |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**             | Real-time data updates between HP ALM and Xray.         | Full transfer of data from HP ALM to Xray.               |
| **Objective**              | Maintain systems in parallel.                           | Consolidate into Xray.                                   |
| **Implementation**         | Requires integration tools or APIs.                     | One-time data export and import.                         |
| **Effort**                 | Continuous maintenance needed.                          | High initial effort but minimal ongoing.                 |
| **Data Integrity**         | Risk of inconsistencies during updates.                 | Ensures complete data consistency.                       |
| **Scalability**            | Limited by sync tool capabilities.                      | Fully scalable in Xray.                                  |
| **System Dependency**      | Requires HP ALM to remain operational.                  | No dependency on HP ALM post-migration.                  |
| **Cost**                   | Ongoing costs for integration tools and monitoring.     | One-time migration cost.                                 |
| **Downtime**               | Minimal downtime; systems remain active.                | Potential downtime during migration.                     |
| **Future Proofing**        | Temporary solution; limits Xray adoption.               | Long-term, modernized approach.                          |
