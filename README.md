Here's a concise table comparing **Sync** vs **Migration** between **HP ALM** and **Xray Test Management**:

| **Aspect**               | **Sync**                                       | **Migration**                                |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | Links and updates data between tools.         | Moves all data from HP ALM to Xray.         |
| **Purpose**               | Real-time collaboration across tools.         | Full transition to Xray.                    |
| **Complexity**            | Low to Medium                                 | High                                         |
| **Data Integrity**        | Dual ownership; consistency risk.             | Single ownership; no data duplication.      |
| **Timeline**              | Short-term                                   | Long-term                                   |
| **Tools Needed**          | Integration tools (e.g., APIs, connectors).   | Data migration tools or custom scripts.     |
| **Effort**                | Ongoing maintenance.                         | One-time, intensive.                        |
| **System Dependency**     | Both systems remain active.                   | HP ALM phased out after migration.          |
| **Cost**                  | Lower initial cost; ongoing sync fees.        | Higher upfront cost; lower post-migration.  |
| **Ideal Use Case**        | Gradual adoption of Xray.                     | Full adoption of Xray Test Management.      |

This table summarizes the key differences to help decide the best approach based on your objectives.
