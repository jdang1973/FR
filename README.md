Yes, both **Jira (Enterprise)** and **Jira Align** support reporting on **Features (Epics in Jira) and their child User Stories**, including those linked to **Xray test cases**. Here’s how you can approach this, including options for exporting and visualizing traceability.

## ✅ **Jira (Enterprise): Feature + Story Report with Xray Links**

### **Option 1: JQL Filter + Export**

Use JQL to query Features and their linked Stories.

**JQL Example:**

```jql
issuetype = Epic AND project = "projectName"
```

Then:

1. Open a Feature.
2. Use the “Issues in Epic” panel to view child Stories.
3. Add columns like `Issue Key`, `Summary`, `Issue Type`, `Epic Link`, and `Xray Test Coverage` (if enabled).
4. Export as CSV or Excel.

If you want to include **Xray test coverage**:

* Use **Xray’s Traceability Report**.

Xray Documentation:**

* [Xray Traceability Report](https://docs.getxray.app/display/XRAYCLOUD/Traceability+Report)
* [Xray Test Coverage Report](https://docs.getxray.app/display/XRAYCLOUD/Test+Coverage+Report)



Jira Align: Feature to Story Traceability Report**

### **Steps:**

1. Go to **Jira Align** > **Reports** > **Feature Backlog** or **Feature Trace Report**
2. Select Program, PI, and Filter options
3. You’ll see a hierarchical structure:

   * **Feature (Jira Epic)**

     * Linked **User Stories**
     * Associated **Xray Test Cases** (if integrated)

### **Export Options:**

* Export to Excel from the report view
* Use API to extract raw data for custom reports
