Best Practices:

Retrospectives: After each sprint or release, hold retrospectives focusing on testing processes to identify improvements.​

Update Test Cases: Regularly review and update test cases to reflect changes in requirements or application behavior.​

Training and Knowledge Sharing: Encourage team members to share insights and updates on testing practices and tools.​

Example:

Post-release, analyze defect trends to identify areas where test coverage can be enhanced, updating or creating new test cases as necessary
