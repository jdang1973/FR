Here’s a concise comparison table highlighting the **top 10 differences** between **manual migration** and **automated integration using Tasktop** for **HP ALM to Jira Xray**:

| **Criteria**                     | **Manual Migration**                                            | **Automated Integration (Tasktop)**                            |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Effort Required**           | High manual effort for data export/import                        | Low ongoing effort after initial setup                         |
| **2. Accuracy**                  | Prone to human error during data handling                        | High accuracy with real-time synchronization                   |
| **3. Speed**                     | Time-consuming and sequential                                    | Fast and continuous data flow                                  |
| **4. Scalability**               | Difficult to scale across projects                               | Easily scales to multiple projects and teams                   |
| **5. Real-time Updates**         | No – requires repeated manual exports                            | Yes – real-time bi-directional updates                         |
| **6. Resource Dependency**       | Requires dedicated QA/admin resources                            | Minimal ongoing human intervention                             |
| **7. Change Tracking**           | Challenging to track incremental changes                         | Automatically syncs changes and updates                        |
| **8. Custom Field Handling**     | Manual mapping and potential loss of metadata                    | Supports complex field mapping and transformation              |
| **9. Maintenance**               | Requires frequent manual checks and troubleshooting              | Centralized management via Tasktop dashboard                   |
| **10. Audit & Compliance**       | Limited audit trail                                              | Full traceability and audit logs for compliance                |
