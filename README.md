### Software Test Traceability Matrix Definition Template

A **Software Test Traceability Matrix (RTM)** is a document that establishes a bi-directional relationship between project requirements, test cases, and defects to ensure comprehensive test coverage and alignment with project objectives.

### Purpose:
1. **Requirement Validation**: Confirm all requirements are addressed through testing.
2. **Defect Tracking**: Link defects to requirements and test cases for efficient resolution.
3. **Coverage Assurance**: Identify gaps in testing to mitigate risks.
4. **Transparency**: Provide a clear traceability trail for audits and stakeholders.

### Key Components:
- **Requirement ID**: Unique identifier for each requirement.
- **Requirement Description**: Summary of the requirement.
- **Test Case ID**: Identifier for test cases linked to the requirement.
- **Defect ID**: Identifier for defects discovered during testing.
- **Test Status**: Current state of the test (e.g., Passed, Failed, Not Run).
- **Remarks**: Notes on observations or pending actions.

This template ensures traceability across the software development lifecycle, promoting quality, accountability, and efficiency.
