 Here’s a concise set of generic software acceptance criteria for features and user stories in a SAFe environment, along with an example:


Software Acceptance Criteria for Financial Services in SAFe
Acceptance criteria define the conditions a feature or user story must satisfy to be considered complete. In the financial services sector within a SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) environment, they are typically focused on ensuring compliance, security, performance, and business value.


Acceptance Criteria for Features and User Stories

	1. Business Value:
		○ The feature or story aligns with the business objectives and delivers measurable value.
		 (e.g., compliance, customer satisfaction, cost efficiency).
	
	2. Clear Definition of Done (DoD):
		○ Code is peer-reviewed and merged into the main branch.
		○ Unit, integration, and acceptance tests pass.
		○ Deployed successfully to a staging environment.
		○ Documentation updated, if applicable.
		
	3. Functional Requirements:
		○ Meets all defined functionality, workflows, and expected behavior.
		○ Handles both positive and negative scenarios gracefully.
		
	4. Compliance and Security
		○ The feature adheres to industry-specific standards and legal requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
		○ All sensitive data is encrypted and follows access control policies.

	5. Non-Functional Requirements:
		○ Ensures performance, scalability, and security standards.
		○ Adheres to defined compliance or regulatory needs.
		
	6. User Experience (UX):
		○ UI and usability conform to design specifications.
		○ Accessible according to WCAG or internal guidelines.
		
	7. Integration and Dependencies:
		○ Works seamlessly with dependent systems or modules.
		○ APIs are validated and function as expected.
		
	8. Testing and Automation:
		○ Sufficient automated and manual test cases ensure no critical defects.
		○ Passes unit, integration, and system testing without critical defects.
		
	9. Traceability:
		○ Linked to program increment objectives, epics, and corresponding stories in the SAFe framework.
		

Example 1:

Feature: Allow users to reset their password securely.

User Story: As a user, I want to reset my password using my email address so that I can regain access to my account securely.

Acceptance Criteria:
	1. Users can request a password reset via the email address associated with their account.
	2. A reset link is sent to the email with a unique, time-bound token (valid for 24 hours).
	3. The token expires after one use or 24 hours.
	4. The reset page is accessible and follows design guidelines.
	5. Password reset is successful only when the new password meets security criteria (e.g., 8+ characters, 1 special character).
	6. System logs password reset events for auditing.
	7. Integration with the email service provider is validated and functional.
	

Example 2:

Feature: Allow bank customers transfer funds  securely.

User Story: As a bank customer, I want to transfer funds between my accounts securely so that I can manage my finances easily.

Acceptance Criteria:
	1. The system allows customers to transfer funds only between linked accounts.
	2. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required before initiating a transfer.
	3. Transfers are processed within 5 seconds under normal load conditions.
	4. The user receives a confirmation email/SMS upon a successful transfer.
	5. Any failed transfer attempt logs an error with detailed audit information.
	6. The feature integrates with the fraud detection service to flag suspicious transactions.
