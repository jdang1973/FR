1. Built-In Quality
Ensure quality is integrated at every stage: planning, development, testing, and release.

Collaborate on testable acceptance criteria and enforce robust Definitions of Done (DoD).

Apply TDD, BDD, and ATDD to align testing with business value.

2. Continuous Testing
Begin testing activities early in the development cycle (“shift left”).

Execute ongoing validation through automated and manual testing across all layers.

Validate functionality, performance, security, and usability.

3. Test Automation
Prioritize automation of unit, integration, API, regression, and E2E tests.

Integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines for fast, repeatable feedback.

Maintain automation scripts in sync with evolving features.

4. Collaboration & Agile Team Integration
Participate fully in PI Planning, Sprint Planning, Standups, Reviews, and Retrospectives.

Partner with Product Owners and developers to refine user stories and acceptance tests.

Encourage shared responsibility for quality across the Agile Release Train (ART).

5. Transparency & Metrics
Track and share test coverage, defect trends, and quality status via dashboards.

Ensure visibility of blockers and risks to support real-time decision-making.

Provide traceability from Features → Stories → Test Cases → Results.

6. Customer-Centric Quality
Ensure features meet business goals and deliver real customer value.

Perform exploratory testing to uncover edge cases and usability issues.

Validate both functional and non-functional requirements before release.

7. Continuous Improvement
Reflect in retrospectives and Inspect & Adapt workshops on what can be improved.

Identify gaps in tooling, coverage, or quality processes and recommend solutions.

Stay current with new testing strategies and SAFe quality guidance.
