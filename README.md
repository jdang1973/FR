Presentation Abstract:

The migration of test artifacts from HP ALM to Enterprise Jira (Xray) presents significant challenges for Retail teams and potentially other groups due to key functionality limitations. HP ALM's test automation and execution capabilities are not fully supported in Xray, making a direct migration infeasible.  This presentation explores alternative solutions for real-time synchronization of test artifacts between HP ALM and Xray, as well as the possibility of sending test automation results from ALM back to Xray. These strategies aim to ensure a seamless transition while maintaining test execution efficiency.
