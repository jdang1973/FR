Subject: Retirement Gift for Allen Liu  

Hi Team,  

As you may know, Allen Liu is retiring soon, with his last working day on 1/31/2025. We’re planning to present him with an Amazon gift card as a token of appreciation from the NFT team.  

If you’d like to contribute, you can send funds via Venmo. This is completely voluntary.  

We’re also planning a farewell lunch near the Minneapolis Federal Bank in January 2025. Details to follow.  

Thank you!
