Your custom ALM test report received great feedback from Management—well done! I need your help with a few adjustments:  

1. Generate detailed reports for all apps across all applications (I’ll explain more in the meeting).  
2. Set up auto-generation of reports at month-end with email alerts (if possible).  
3. Once steps 1 & 2 are done, I’ll use the reports and work with Lillian Lue to showcase your final work on tableu.frb.org.
