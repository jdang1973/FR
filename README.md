Jira's Xray test management tool is a powerful solution for managing software quality assurance, and it provides extensive capabilities to track and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs). Here are the **top 10 software quality KPIs** available in Xray for Jira:

### 1. **Test Execution Progress**
   - Tracks the progress of executed tests versus total planned tests.
   - Useful for monitoring whether test plans are on schedule.
   - Breakdown includes tests executed, passed, failed, and blocked.

### 2. **Test Coverage (Requirements/Stories)**
   - Measures the percentage of requirements or user stories covered by test cases.
   - Ensures traceability between tests and requirements.
   - Highlights gaps in test coverage.

### 3. **Defect Density**
   - Number of defects identified per module or per unit of test effort (e.g., per 1000 lines of code).
   - Helps in identifying high-risk areas of the software.

### 4. **Defect Status Distribution**
   - Provides insights into the current state of defects (e.g., open, in progress, closed).
   - Ensures efficient defect lifecycle management and resolution timelines.

### 5. **Test Execution Status by Version/Release**
   - Tracks test execution results specific to a version or release.
   - Useful for determining release readiness.

### 6. **Test Plan Completion Rate**
   - Percentage of tests completed relative to the total planned tests.
   - Helps gauge the completion status of testing activities.

### 7. **Average Time to Test Execution**
   - Measures the time taken to execute tests on average.
   - Useful for assessing test efficiency and identifying bottlenecks.

### 8. **Automated vs. Manual Test Execution**
   - Tracks the proportion of automated versus manual test executions.
   - Helps measure automation coverage and its impact on testing cycles.

### 9. **Defect Detection Rate**
   - Measures the rate of defect detection during testing.
   - Indicates the effectiveness of the testing process.

### 10. **Reopened Defects**
   - Tracks the number of defects reopened after being marked as resolved.
   - Helps assess the quality of defect resolution processes.

### Leveraging These KPIs in Jira - Xray
These KPIs can be visualized in **Dashboards**, using Jira gadgets and Xray's built-in reporting features, or through integrations with BI tools like Power BI. Additionally, automation rules in Jira can send alerts or notifications for specific KPI thresholds, keeping stakeholders informed in real time.
