 
### Top 10 Differences: Sync vs Migration (HP ALM Test Management with Xray)

| Aspect               | Sync                                        | Migration                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Keeps data in both tools in sync           | Moves all data from HP ALM to Xray         |
| **Scope**            | Selective (specific projects or data)      | Entire repository or projects              |
| **Timeline**         | Continuous or periodic updates             | One-time activity                          |
| **Complexity**       | Moderate (requires ongoing maintenance)    | High (requires careful planning)           |
| **Data Retention**   | Data remains in both systems               | Data resides only in Xray post-migration   |
| **Integration**      | Requires integration setup                 | May not need post-migration integration    |
| **Effort**           | Ongoing                                    | High upfront, minimal afterward            |
| **Risk**             | Lower (data remains in both systems)       | Higher (data loss risk if not handled well)|
| **Use Case**         | Coexistence of both systems                | Full transition to Xray                    |
| **Cost**             | Ongoing integration costs                  | One-time migration costs                   |
