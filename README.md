10 Expectations for Software Quality Engineering in SAFe

Continuous Integration & Testing – Frequent integration and automated tests for rapid feedback.

Built-In Quality – Embedding quality throughout the development lifecycle, not inspecting in later.

Automation First Approach – Leveraging automation extensively for consistent and efficient testing.

Collaboration in Agile Teams – Close cooperation with development and product management teams.

Shift-Left Testing – Early testing to detect issues when they’re less costly to resolve.

Test-Driven Development (TDD)/Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) – Encouraging precise requirements and testable code.

System-level Quality Focus – End-to-end testing to ensure overall system integrity.

Quality Metrics and Reporting – Using clear metrics to measure and communicate quality status.

Risk-based Testing – Prioritizing tests based on risks to ensure maximum coverage where most needed.

Continuous Improvement – Regularly identifying opportunities for better quality processes and practices.

----
Built-in Quality – Quality is integrated from the start, not tested in later.

Test Automation – Promote continuous testing via automated tests.

Shift-Left Testing – Engage in early testing during requirements and design phases.

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) – Collaborate using examples to define behavior.

Exploratory Testing – Go beyond scripts to uncover hidden issues.
