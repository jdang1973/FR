Here are best practices to evaluate whether a **test case should be automated**, focusing on maximizing value, stability, and efficiency in your test automation efforts:



**Best Practices to Evaluate Test Cases for Automation**

---

#### 1. **Run Frequency**

* **Automate if:** The test case is executed frequently (e.g., smoke, regression, sanity).
* **Skip if:** It's a one-time or rarely executed test.

#### 2. **Stability of Functionality**

* **Automate if:** The functionality under test is stable and unlikely to change.
* **Skip if:** It's still in active development or subject to frequent UI/API changes.

#### 3. **Test Case Predictability**

* **Automate if:** The expected outcome is clear, consistent, and easy to validate programmatically.
* **Skip if:** It requires heavy visual validation or subjective human judgment.

#### 4. **Return on Investment (ROI)**

* **Automate if:** The time saved over repeated runs justifies the initial automation effort.
* **Skip if:** Automation would be too complex or costly to implement for minimal gain.

#### 5. **Data Requirements**

* **Automate if:** The test uses reusable, predictable, or mockable data sets.
* **Skip if:** It relies heavily on complex, dynamic, or hard-to-generate test data.

#### 6. **Test Execution Time**

* **Automate if:** The test is time-consuming to run manually.
* **Skip if:** Manual execution is quick and straightforward with minimal effort.

#### 7. **Cross-Browser/Device Coverage**

* **Automate if:** The test needs to be run across multiple browsers or devices.

#### 8. **Risk and Business Impact**

* **Automate if:** The test covers a high-risk or critical business path (e.g., checkout, login).
* **Skip if:** It tests a minor, non-essential feature with low impact.

#### 9. **Environment Readiness**

* **Automate if:** The environment is stable, supports automation frameworks, and has CI/CD integration.
* **Skip if:** The test requires extensive environment setup or is not automation-friendly.

#### 10. **Maintenance Overhead**

* **Automate if:** The test is not too brittle and will not frequently break due to minor UI or logic changes.
* **Skip if:** It is prone to frequent failures due to minor changes or has high flakiness.

 **Good Candidates for Automation**

* Regression test suites
* Smoke and sanity checks
* Data-driven tests with repeatable inputs
* API testing and backend validations
* Login, search, checkout flows

Poor Candidates for Automation**

* One-off or exploratory tests
* Tests with frequent UI changes
* Visual layout or CAPTCHA validation
* Highly subjective or usability tests
