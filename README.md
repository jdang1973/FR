3. **Use of Preconditions*: îˆƒDefine preconditions to specify the state of the system before test execution. This helps in setting up the test environment correcty.îˆ„îˆ†

4. **Parameterization*: îˆƒImplement parameterized tests to execute the same test logic with different data sets, enhancing test coverage without redundany.îˆ„îˆ†

5. **Traceability*: îˆƒLink tests to requirements or user stories to ensure traceability and coverage analyss.
