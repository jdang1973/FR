 

I recently joined FRFS Retail, and I’m writing regarding Allen, who reports to me. His last working day is Friday, Feb 28, and he mentioned he hasn't received instructions on the process for retaining his banking laptop as a retirement gift, as noted in your email dated September 18. Could you please advise on the next steps?

 

I’m John Dang, recently joined FRFS Retail. Allen reports to me, and his last working day is Friday, Feb 28. He mentioned that he hasn’t received instructions on the next steps for keeping his banking laptop as a retirement gift, as mentioned in your email from Sept 18.  

Could you provide guidance on this?
