Subject: Contribution for Allen's Retirement Gift

Allen Liu is retiring soon, with his last working day on 1/31/2025. We’re organizing a retirement gift as a token of appreciation from the NFT team. Contributions are voluntary, and we plan to give him an Amazon gift card.

If you’d like to contribute, please send funds via Venmo.

Additionally, we’re planning a lunch with Allen near the Minneapolis Federal Bank in January 2025 before his last day. Let me know if you’re interested in joining!
