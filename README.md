In a **Scaled Agile (SAFe)** or Agile environment, **Quality Engineering (QE)** should create the **software test plan earlyâ€”but adaptively**, evolving it throughout the Program Increment (PI) and Iterations. Here's a practical breakdown of **when** and **why** to create or update it:

---

*When Should QE Create a Software Test Plan?**

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Before or During PI Planning (Initial Planning Phase)**

**When:** 1â€“2 weeks before or during PI Planning
**Why:**

* To align QE efforts with **business priorities**, **features**, and **team objectives**
* To identify **test scope**, **environments**, **tools**, and **dependencies** early
* To prepare for cross-team **integration testing**

**What to include:**

* High-level test strategy
* Initial risk assessment
* Resource/test environment needs
* Automation goals
* Feature-level test planning

---

 **2. During Iteration (Sprint) Planning**

**When:** At the start of each sprint
**Why:**

* Translate high-level test planning into actionable story-level test tasks
* Plan manual, automated, and exploratory tests
* Ensure **Definition of Done (DoD)** includes testing

**What to include:**

* Detailed test cases linked to stories
* Automation tasks
* Test data needs
* Expected results and acceptance criteria

---

 **3. Continuously During Execution**

**When:** Throughout the iteration/PI
**Why:**

* Requirements or designs may change
* Bugs or feedback may shift testing priorities
* Adaptive planning helps respond to risks or delays

**Update:**

* Coverage tracking
* Test case revisions
* Defect logs and test metrics
* Updated traceability to features/stories

---

 **4. End of Iteration or PI (Retrospective & Inspect & Adapt)**

**When:** At the close of each sprint and PI
**Why:**

* Evaluate effectiveness of the test plan
* Capture lessons learned
* Feed improvements into the next planning cycle

**What to review:**

* Test coverage and defect trends
* Missed scenarios or delays
* Environment or tool issues
* Recommendations for the next PI

| Phase               | Action                                                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-PI Planning** | Draft high-level test strategy, risks, dependencies                  |
| **PI Planning**     | Align test plan with PI objectives and feature delivery              |
| **Sprint Planning** | Build detailed test tasks, cases, and automation plans               |
| **Execution**       | Continuously refine test plans, update based on feedback and results |
| **PI Review**       | Retrospect test outcomes and improve planning for next PI            |
